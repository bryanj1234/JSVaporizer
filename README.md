# JS Vaporizer

```
We must cut out the BS JS
	which goofs up our day.  
It's an uncontrollable time thief,
	so we should get it out of the way.
```

This project is motivated by unifying front end and back end code for Razor Pages applications,
without committing to Blazor.

It's a simple application of
[Microsoft.NET.Runtime.WebAssembly.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Runtime.WebAssembly.Sdk)
combined with [JavaScript interop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.interopservices.javascript?view=net-8.0).

***Currently supports only .NET 8***
